In the provided Terraform configuration, the S3 bucket for the remote backend is not created by the code itself. Instead, it's referenced in the terraform block:


terraform {
  backend "s3" {
    bucket         = "my-terraform-state-bucket"
    key            = "networking/terraform.tfstate"
    region         = "us-east-1"
    encrypt        = true
    dynamodb_table = "terraform-locks"
  }
}

üîç Explanation:
Terraform does not allow the backend resources (like S3 and DynamoDB for state) to be provisioned in the same configuration that uses them.

This is because Terraform needs the backend to already exist before it can initialize and use it.

‚úÖ What You Need to Do:
You should manually or separately provision:

S3 Bucket (e.g., my-terraform-state-bucket)

DynamoDB Table (e.g., terraform-locks) for state locking

üõ†Ô∏è Optional: Bootstrap Script (Run Once Manually)
You can use this separate script (not as part of your main TF config):

hcl
Copy
Edit
provider "aws" {
  region = "us-east-1"
}

resource "aws_s3_bucket" "tf_state" {
  bucket = "my-terraform-state-bucket"
  acl    = "private"

  versioning {
    enabled = true
  }

  server_side_encryption_configuration {
    rule {
      apply_server_side_encryption_by_default {
        sse_algorithm     = "aws:kms"
        kms_master_key_id = aws_kms_key.tf_state.id
      }
    }
  }

  tags = {
    Name = "Terraform State Bucket"
  }
}

resource "aws_dynamodb_table" "tf_locks" {
  name         = "terraform-locks"
  billing_mode = "PAY_PER_REQUEST"
  hash_key     = "LockID"

  attribute {
    name = "LockID"
    type = "S"
  }

  tags = {
    Name = "Terraform Lock Table"
  }
}

resource "aws_kms_key" "tf_state" {
  description = "KMS key for Terraform state encryption"
  enable_key_rotation = true
}
üöÄ Once created, you can delete this script or move it to a bootstrap folder. It should not be part of the main infrastructure project.
